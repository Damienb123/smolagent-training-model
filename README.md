# smolagent-training-model
This project demonstrates the use of the `smolagents` library to create an intelligent agent that assists with party preparations. The agent uses a tool to suggest menus based on the occasion and calculates the total preparation time for the party.

## Features

- **Menu Suggestion**: The agent can suggest a menu based on the type of occasion (casual, formal, superhero, etc.).
- **Task Management**: The agent calculates the total time required to complete a list of tasks for party preparation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Damienb123/training-model.git
    cd training-model
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install smolagents numpy
    ```

## Usage

Run the [training-model.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) script to see the agent in action:
```sh
python training-model.py
```
